1. The computer picks a random number between 1 and 100.
2. The player is asked to guess the number.
3. After each guess, the game gives a hint:
   - `"Too low!"` if the guess is less than the number.
   - `"Too high!"` if the guess is greater.
   - `"🎉 Congratulations!"` if the guess is correct.
4. The total number of attempts is shown at the end.
